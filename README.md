## Clockwork Zork
This is a "tribute" to zork using some of its mechanics.


##  Story (Spoiler)
You are in a 1950years-looking skyland. You wake up in your house and you have a note from a friend.
You just have to get to another room. No combat, weapons or armour. Just a little trick to discover how to get
to the end. Actually its more of an ultra-mini puzle than a zork.


##  Map
The map has 6 rooms conected in this order: your house, a circular plaza/square.  From this point you can get to 4 other rooms, north/east/south/west city. It depends on a trick (explained in wlakthrough!). The last room, the forge is connected to the north city. A map wouldn't help much...

##  Gameplay mechanichs
You can:
* /look -something-
* /go -direction-
* /-direction- (to write less)
* /take -something-
* /drop -something-
* /settime -clockname- -hour-


##  Walkthrough guide
Its a game about a mini-puzle. It can be confusing so here goes the answer.
In this game there are 2 exits (your house's door, and a stairway) that will have the same direction as the clock hand from the clock in your house (that's not a pickable item)
In order to beat the game change the clock's hour in the apartment "/settime clock 12". 
This will change the direction of 2 exits and the destination of one of them. It will get you to the north city, then to the forge where you can find the final note.


##  Items
Box: A box with your properties
Note: a note from a friend with instructions
Watch: your watch (i couldn't make any other time mechanic, for now...)
Clock of your house: you can change its hour. But only to 3,6,9 or 12 o'clock
Create: Just a crate with a sword (not very usefull for the purpose of this zork)
Letter: Final letter from your friend
